# My Single-Page HTML CV

I created a **single-page CV** using only **HTML** to showcase my education, skills, and career history. The goal was to focus on **semantic HTML**, basic **SEO**, and creating a clean structure ready for styling later.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to learn how to:

- Structure a CV using proper HTML tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)  
- Include SEO meta tags and Open Graph tags for better visibility  
- Prepare a single-page layout that is easy to read and extend  

This project gave me a solid foundation to move on to **styling with CSS** and making my CV visually appealing.
